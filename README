This is a prototype version of the Modeller's Tookit, which will be operated 
from the command line with the modelling settings defined using a configuration
file. The toolkit will firstly take input data including source geometry,
earthquake catalogue, fault data and geodetci strain data. Then it will apply
pre-processing steps (e.g. declusting, completeness analysis of catalogue,
geometrical definitions of fault etc.) and modelling steps to define completely
the parameters needed to define a PSHA source.
The toolkit will then output the complete PSHA source model in the nrml format.
